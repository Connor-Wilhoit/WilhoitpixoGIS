# WilhoitpixoGIS
Simple Android Application Utilizing Google's GPS API - Pixotech Application

To enable this app to properly work, you'll need to add-in your own developer API key from Google.
Documentation to do so is available at: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/signup
Or, for a simpler version: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start

Additionally, if you're familiar w/Android development, you'll notice I only added the 'java' subdirectory of the 'app'
directory structure, and this is because the actual source code for this app is so simple that you can just copy and paste
as needed into your own app.  Most of the code is just modified from the example app on how to use the Google Maps API anyhow.



This is a very basic application illustrating basic interaction w/the Google Maps API for Android.
It's intended purpose was for an intership application for a company called Pixotech, hence the namespace used within "WilhoitpixoGIS".
