# WilhoitpixoGIS
Simple Android Application Utilizing Google's GPS API - Pixotech Application

To enable this app to properly work, you'll need to add-in your own developer API key from Google.
Documentation to do so is available at: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/signup
Or, for a simpler version: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start

This is a very basic application illustrating basic interaction w/the Google Maps API for Android.
It's intended purpose was for an intership application for a company called Pixotech, hence the namespace used within "WilhoitpixoGIS".
